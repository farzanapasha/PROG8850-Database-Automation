# MySQL Database CI/CD Pipeline with Performance Monitoring

## Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for automating MySQL database schema changes and deployments. The goal is to create a robust pipeline that ensures smooth deployment, concurrent query execution, and query performance optimization. 

Additionally, the project integrates advanced monitoring and logging using **Signoz**, a platform that provides real-time insights into database performance, including CPU usage, slow queries, and other critical metrics. This allows for continuous performance analysis to detect bottlenecks and optimize SQL queries for better resource utilization and response time.

## Features
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates MySQL schema changes and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Concurrent Query Execution**: Handles multiple queries concurrently, ensuring efficient execution of tasks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes optimizations to improve SQL query performance and reduce resource consumption.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated with Signoz for monitoring database performance metrics like CPU usage, slow queries, and more.
- **Automated Performance Analysis**: Detects performance bottlenecks and provides recommendations for SQL query optimization.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **GitHub**: To access the repository and GitHub Actions.
- **MySQL**: To manage the MySQL database for schema changes.
- **Signoz**: For monitoring and performance tracking.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and MySQL for a consistent environment.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mysql-cicd-performance.git
   cd mysql-cicd-performance

2. **Set up MySQL database**:
    - Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
    - Create a ClimateData table or update the schema as needed.

3. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
    - Set up a .github/workflows/ci_cd_pipeline.yml file in your repository with the necessary steps for schema deployment, query execution, and performance optimizations.

4. **Configure Signoz**:
    - Set up Signoz for real-time performance monitoring.
    - Integrate with MySQL to gather metrics on query performance and system resource usage.
